# Semantic Search

### Overview

Unlike traditional search engines, semantic search engines don't just look for keywords in a document. They look for the meaning of the document and try to find documents that are similar in meaning.

This is enabled by the concept of embeddings. Embeddings are a way to represent words and documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Similar words and documents are closer together in this space.

Semantic search tries to understand the intent behind the query. It's not just about the words you use, but the meaning behind them.

### How it works

> Imports

```JavaScript
import 'dotenv/config'
import { Document } from 'langchain/document'
import { MemoryVectorStore } from 'langchain/vectorstores/memory'
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from 'langchain/embeddings/openai'

```

- `dotenv/config`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `langchain/document`: Imports the `Document` class, used to structure data for vector indexing.
- `langchain/vectorstores/memory`: Imports the `MemoryVectorStore`, an in-memory storage for vectors (semantic representations of data).
- `langchain/embeddings/openai`: Imports the `OpenAIEmbeddings`, which interfaces with OpenAI to obtain semantic embeddings for data.

> Create Store Function

```JavaScript

const createStore = () =>
  MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
    movies.map(
      (movie) =>
        new Document({
          pageContent: `Title: ${movie.title}\n${movie.description}`,
          metadata: { source: movie.id, title: movie.title },
        })
    ),
    new OpenAIEmbeddings()
  )

```

> Search Function

```JavaScript
export const search = async (query, count = 1) => {
  const store = await createStore()
  return store.similaritySearch(query, count)
}
```

> Execute a search

```JavaScript
console.log(await search('For kids...'))
```

`node search.js`

### Conclusion

In the realm of search technology, semantic search stands as a game-changer. By focusing on the meaning behind words rather than the words themselves, it offers a more intuitive and context-aware approach to information retrieval. 

The use of embeddings to represent words and documents in high-dimensional space allows for the identification of similar content based on semantic similarity. This article has provided a glimpse into the workings of semantic search, demonstrating how to create a semantic search engine using JavaScript and the OpenAI API.

 As we move forward, the adoption and refinement of semantic search will undoubtedly continue to revolutionize how we interact with information.
